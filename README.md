PirateBox-Responsive
====================

Responsive layout to use with your [PirateBox](http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/). This will update the look of both your index, and file list pages.

To install, simply drop the files(not folders!) from the **/www/**, **/python_lib/**, and **/conf/** folders into the corresponding folders on your PirateBox.

**HEADER.txt** and **README.txt** in the **/src/** folder need to be dropped into your **/Shared/** folder to take effect.

This layout assumes you have the Kareha forum installed on your PirateBox and has a link in the header pointing to it. If you don't have it installed, comment out/delete line 25 of 'index.html'.
